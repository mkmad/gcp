## Border Gateway Protocol Routing

When a VPN tunnel is established, BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) can be used to dynamically exchange routing information between the two ends of the tunnel. 
Here's how it works:

1. VPN Tunnel Establishment:

    - A VPN tunnel is created between two networks, establishing a secure connection.
    - Each end of the tunnel has a VPN gateway or router responsible for managing the VPN connection and routing traffic.

2. BGP Peering:

    - The VPN gateways or routers on both ends of the tunnel are configured as BGP peers.
    - BGP peering involves exchanging BGP messages to establish a neighbor relationship and share routing information.

3. BGP Route Advertisement:

    - Each VPN gateway advertises its own network prefixes (IP address ranges) and any other prefixes it has learned from other BGP peers or internal routing protocols to its BGP peer across the VPN tunnel.
    - These advertisements typically include attributes like the AS path (a list of autonomous systems the route has passed through) and local preference (a measure of how preferred the route is).
4. BGP Route Selection:

    - Each VPN gateway receives route advertisements from its peer and uses BGP's decision process to select the best path for each destination prefix.
    - BGP's decision process considers various factors, including local preference, AS path length, and other route attributes, to determine the most optimal route.

5. Routing Table Update:

    - The selected routes are added to the routing table of each VPN gateway.
    - These routes define the path that traffic should take to reach destinations on the other side of the VPN tunnel.

6. Traffic Forwarding:

    - When traffic destined for a network on the other side of the VPN tunnel arrives at a VPN gateway, the gateway consults its routing table and forwards the traffic through the VPN tunnel based on the learned BGP routes.

### Benefits of using BGP for VPN routing

- Dynamic Routing: BGP automatically adapts to changes in network topology or reachability, ensuring that traffic is always routed along the best available path.
Scalability: BGP can handle large numbers of routes and peers, making it suitable for complex VPN environments.
Flexibility: BGP supports various route attributes and policies, allowing for fine-grained control over traffic routing.
Key Points:

- BGP is an exterior gateway protocol primarily used for routing between autonomous systems (AS) on the internet, but it's increasingly used for VPN routing.
BGP peering can be established over various VPN technologies like IPsec or MPLS.
BGP is not the only way to route traffic over VPNs; static routes or dynamic routing protocols like OSPF or EIGRP can also be used, but they may not be as scalable or flexible as BGP.
